**Installing a Hypervisor and Virtual Machine:**

Hypervisor - A Hypervisor is the device or software that runs the virtual machine. It acts as the interface and liason between the "guest" virtual machine and the host system. Hypervisors manages system resources and allocates them to multiple operating systems running on the same physical machine.

Virtual Machine - A software-based computer that runs within a physical computer. (i.e. Running Windows 11 on a Linux Machine). VM's are isolated with their own CPU, memory, storage, etc.

Hypervisor/Virtual Machine use cases:
  - Automation/Scripting
  - Home Server
  - Security Lab
  - Containerization

The Hypervisor I will be using is Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) with QEMU Virtual Machine emulator.
